## Setting up multiple Minecraft instances
This script assumes you have multiple instances of minecraft running using MultiMC or similar.  
Learn how to setup minecraft with MultiMC and speedrunning mods here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL8Syekw4Q0.  
After setting up MultiMC select an instance and click "Copy Instance" to create more.

## What if i don't trust .exe file?
You can also run the AutoHotKey script directly (used to make the exe). Install the [current version of AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and open the `SimpleWallScript.ahk` file included in the release.
